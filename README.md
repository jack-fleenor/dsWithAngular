# Data Structures with Angular
This is a personal portfolio project in Angular that provides a description and sample implementations of three commonly used linked list data structures: Single Linked List, Double Linked List, and Circular Linked List.

## Introduction
Linked lists are fundamental data structures used in computer science and programming. This project serves as an educational resource to understand and implement three types of linked lists: Single Linked List, Double Linked List, and Circular Linked List in Angular. The project provides code samples, explanations, and a simple user interface to visualize and interact with these data structures.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js installed on your system.
- Angular CLI installed.
- A code editor, such as Visual Studio Code.

## Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine:

#### Copy code
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
```
#### Change your working directory to the project folder:
```bash
cd angular-linked-list-data-structures
```
#### Install the required dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
#### Start the development server:
``` bash
ng serve
```
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/ to interact with the project.

### Single Linked List
The Single Linked List is a linear data structure in which each element points to the next element, forming a chain. This project includes a sample implementation of a Single Linked List, which you can explore and visualize in the user interface.

### Double Linked List
The Double Linked List is similar to the Single Linked List, but each element points to both the next and previous elements. This allows for more versatile operations, such as traversal in both directions. The project includes a sample implementation of a Double Linked List.

### Circular Linked List
A Circular Linked List is a variation of a linked list where the last element points back to the first element, creating a loop. This project provides a sample implementation of a Circular Linked List, and you can see how it works in the user interface.
